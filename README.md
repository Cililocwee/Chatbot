# Chatbot
This isn't so much a chatbot as much it is just randomly pulling quotes from famchat and acting like it's people

Lots of weird workarounds

sadnessBot is self-sustaining and chats with itself

randomBot actually takes user input and then does precisely nothing with it, just spits out random quotes
