[shane = new Shane();] [5:43 PM] and I went a bit too far I think but you know what they say, "no sense crying over cut pubes"
[100% not Corrie] [5:52 PM] So you went for manscaping and wound up infantscaping instead?
[100% not Corrie] [5:53 PM] Can you see yourself in the reflection from your shiny junk?
[shane = new Shane();] [6:05 PM] the only thing that could make my small dick look even more babyish is the complete baldness I'm suffering

[Victoria (Gelb)] [8:58 PM] anyway I got a new tongue piercing but it is still too big
[100% not Corrie] [9:02 PM] Oooo too big

[100% not Corrie] [9:02 PM] Remember, tongues are emotional
[100% not Corrie] [9:02 PM] Gotta get it there mentally
[100% not Corrie] [9:02 PM] Light some candles, put on some Barry white or skrillex

[shane = new Shane();] [12:36 AM] what was I even doing g
[100% not Corrie] [1:08 AM] Porn
[100% not Corrie] [1:08 AM] Obvs
[shane = new Shane();] [1:17 AM] I have a problem i think
[shane = new Shane();] [1:17 AM] tt
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:14 AM] why r u all asleep
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:14 AM] wait
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:14 AM] NO YOURE NOT
[100% not Corrie] [3:14 AM] Why are you fucking telling lies about me
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 AM] yayyyyyyy
[100% not Corrie] [3:15 AM] I sleep when I want
[100% not Corrie] [3:15 AM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 AM] I just woke up and finished the pringles
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 AM] that is true
[100% not Corrie] [3:15 AM] Sounds like a milestone
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 AM] why are YOU awake
[100% not Corrie] [3:16 AM] You ever think about what you want in life and realize that what you want would amount to a check you can't cash?
[100% not Corrie] [3:16 AM] Like a video game... You want that end game armor, but it requires your class being a mage
[100% not Corrie] [3:16 AM] And yet, you're a warrior or some shit
[100% not Corrie] [3:16 AM] Even if you had it, you couldn't use it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:16 AM] why cant you cash it? because at some banks you need the same amount of money in your bank
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:16 AM] ah
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:16 AM] yeah
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:17 AM] but you want it for completion
[100% not Corrie] [3:17 AM] Not even that
[100% not Corrie] [3:17 AM] You think it looks cool, it'd be cool to wear it and do things in it
[100% not Corrie] [3:17 AM] But you know if you had it, you wouldn't be able to do that cool shit you want to do
[100% not Corrie] [3:17 AM] So you get YOUR class's end game armor
[100% not Corrie] [3:18 AM] And it's fucking sweet
[100% not Corrie] [3:18 AM] But because it's not the armor you wanted, it doesn't feel as end-all-be-all
[100% not Corrie] [3:18 AM] Even if you know it's great in its own right
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:18 AM] hmm
[100% not Corrie] [3:18 AM] Life. Man.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:18 AM] life is different man
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:19 AM] it's never to late to change your class
[100% not Corrie] [3:19 AM] Naw, it is. Because at the end of the day, I enjoy my class. I just enjoy the armor of another class
[100% not Corrie] [3:19 AM] Grass is always greener.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:22 AM] I understand
[100% not Corrie] [3:22 AM] Ennui's a bitch.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:23 AM] I think life is like
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:23 AM] you have a certain set of datable characters in skyrim, but the character you REALLY want to date is this npc with a highly developed backstory but they aren't an option
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 AM] so they only why you can date them is with hacks
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 AM] which is cheating
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 AM] ...in more ways than one
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 AM] the end
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 AM] Lol
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 AM] Goes beyond hacks. You'd have to mod the ai in for the character.
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 AM] At which point you're not even playing the game anymore.
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 AM] You're playing YOUR game
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:25 AM] whoa man
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 AM] No one wants to play their own game. It's like playing chess against yourself.
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 AM] Every game ever with godmode enabled. Fucking borefest after like 5 minutes.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:25 AM] which is awesome because no one can see when I but the pieces in my butt
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 AM] oh I mean yeah
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 AM] Butt stuff is love.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 AM] total borefest
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 AM] Butt stuff is life.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 AM] hahahahha
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 AM] tl;dr do you ever realize life is, like, buttstuff?
[100% not Corrie] [3:27 AM] Sometimes you wanna do it cause it's taboo but sometimes it's just not your bag?
[100% not Corrie] [3:27 AM] Oh, re: an earlier conversation
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:27 AM] oh yeah like scatporn or going to the grocery store topless
[100% not Corrie] [3:28 AM] I think that Kelly could be convinced to fuck me in the ass, maaaaaaaaaaan
[100% not Corrie] [3:28 AM] Remember. Dream girl
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:28 AM] !!!!!!!!@
[100% not Corrie] [3:28 AM] Guy's gotta have a butt fucker, yo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:28 AM] that is kick. ass.
[100% not Corrie] [3:28 AM] Ionno, I think she'd be down eventually
[100% not Corrie] [3:28 AM] (emoticon)
[100% not Corrie] [3:29 AM] But again, armor, class, grass, ass
[100% not Corrie] [3:29 AM] Dunno where what falls anymore
[100% not Corrie] [3:29 AM] Dunno if my current class has the ass spec
[100% not Corrie] [3:29 AM] That ass spec
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:30 AM] dat ass spec'
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] That's where the word aspect comes from, btw
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] Little known fact
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:30 AM] little known erroneous fact
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] Naw, it's true
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] I saw it in the discovery Channel last year
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] Stephen Fry did a whole linguistics special on it
[100% not Corrie] [3:30 AM] Backed up by an Oxford study
[100% not Corrie] [3:31 AM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:31 AM] paid for in part by Donald tRUMP
[100% not Corrie] [3:31 AM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:31 AM] and viewers like you!
[100% not Corrie] [3:31 AM] You can trust me. I'm a linguist.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:32 AM] oooo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:32 AM] is that like
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:32 AM] a pasta
[100% not Corrie] [3:32 AM] .... Linguine? No, you're thinking of the really souped up Italian sports cars
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:32 AM] yeah!
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:32 AM] thank you for telling me what I am thinking
[100% not Corrie] [3:33 AM] I am a man. That's our job, telling women what to think.
[100% not Corrie] [3:33 AM] Else, y'all wouldn't have a single thought in your pretty little heads
[100% not Corrie] [3:33 AM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:33 AM] oh that must be true because you called me pretty
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 AM] hmmm
[100% not Corrie] [3:34 AM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 AM] I used to think ennui and staving off existential doom made me a more intelligent person than everyone else
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 AM] when I was in high school
[100% not Corrie] [3:34 AM] Same here
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] Now it just pisses me off.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:35 AM] yap
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] Fucking mind. Why can't you just be fucking happy.
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] Like... You've got a fucking 2
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] And another goddamn 2
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] So make 4-monade
[100% not Corrie] [3:35 AM] Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:36 AM] like if I stop and let myself be happy, I am not giving adequate intellectual weight to my own meaninglessness
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:36 AM] hahahahhaah
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:36 AM] 4monode
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:36 AM] 4monade
[100% not Corrie] [3:37 AM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [3:38 AM] Why're you up so late?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 AM] kitttttttttteh
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 AM] idk I woke up because I was having a bad dream
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 AM] That's called life, dear
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 AM] oh no
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 AM] I woke up because I was having a life
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 AM] There ya go
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 AM] did I ever tell the one time I woke up and was all
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 AM] Megaman itches
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 AM] "what if people are cells and earth is just...one big anatomical system in a large cosmic organism"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 AM] like what if we are like the liver of some cosmic being
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 AM] So you dreamed paganism?
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 AM] Gaiaism
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:48 AM] hmm
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:49 AM] well not necessarily a self regulating system
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:49 AM] because a liver can't exist on its own, even with the best efforts of the cell that comprises it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:49 AM] man, that always blew my mind
[100% not Corrie] [3:50 AM] You're assuming the organs of the universe would work like the organs of life on this planet
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] yeah and that is too specific
[100% not Corrie] [3:50 AM] We're made of this earth. This earth is made of the dust of the universe.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] false
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] at this moment
[100% not Corrie] [3:50 AM] We are made of the universe and are part of the universe.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] I am mostly pringles
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] yeah I know
[100% not Corrie] [3:50 AM] Which were made in earth
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:50 AM] we are the universe staring back at itself
[100% not Corrie] [3:51 AM] We are the sensory organs the universe uses to know itself
[100% not Corrie] [3:51 AM] Like our consciousness is the sensory organ we use to explore ourselves
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:51 AM] huh
[100% not Corrie] [3:51 AM] The study of the human mind is literally the brain studying itself
[100% not Corrie] [3:51 AM] The universe is recursion.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] I always felt like that approached
[100% not Corrie] [3:52 AM] So it is in the micro, so it is in the macro
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] godel's incompleteness theorem
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] ya
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] fractals man!
[100% not Corrie] [3:52 AM] What if past the gluons and quarks
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] self similiarity
[100% not Corrie] [3:52 AM] In the gooey matter that makes up particles
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:52 AM] there is pie?
[100% not Corrie] [3:52 AM] What if there's our universe
[100% not Corrie] [3:53 AM] You can't destroy or create matter
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:53 AM] but there is, man
[100% not Corrie] [3:53 AM] Because matter is our universe
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:55 AM] matter can be created and destroyed
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:56 AM] energy cant
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:56 AM] man I am gonna try to go back to sleep

[shane = new Shane();] [9:48 PM] oops
[shane = new Shane();] [9:48 PM] that's a good question and he wasn't here earlier so
[shane = new Shane();] [9:48 PM] i think he flew in with me when i walked in an hour ago
[shane = new Shane();] [9:48 PM] secret agent mogi
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:49 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [9:50 PM] he spent half of his life span waiting for me to come home
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] dude i just checked Eike's reddit account
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] randomly because i was on /r/kpop
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] he's been posting to /r/hapas like constantly for a day now
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:52 PM] is it impressive
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:52 PM] anything interesting?
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] /r/hapas by the way
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] this is the sidebar
[shane = new Shane();] [9:52 PM] A Subreddit devoted to providing a safe space for Eurasians to discuss the unique challenges of being children of White Fathers and Asian Mothers.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:53 PM] Is he looking into the future of him and the gf
[shane = new Shane();] [9:53 PM] it's a sub completely devoted to complaining about being half asian and hating their mothers for fucking white dudes
[shane = new Shane();] [9:53 PM] yes and he's been like obsessing over it
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:53 PM] creepy obsessing?
[shane = new Shane();] [9:54 PM] I don't know, I can't comment on that
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:54 PM] I was looking at a roast on rkorea and was wondering if it spoke on anyone in the reddit chat but i dont know account names 
[shane = new Shane();] [9:54 PM] but I can say that reading these subs and trying to interact with these people is pointless and bad for mental health
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:54 PM] Well go im for being proactive i guess
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:54 PM] nvm
[shane = new Shane();] [9:54 PM] I looked at that thread and didn't recognize any names
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:54 PM] he should get help
[shane = new Shane();] [9:54 PM] kkk
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:54 PM] you should help him
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:55 PM] you have stuff in come
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:55 PM] kpop
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 PM] most of the people in chat really don't talk on /r/korea
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:55 PM] computers
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:55 PM] korean gf
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 PM] except I still kind of suspect Tom has an account that I hate
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:55 PM] I assumed Tom was on the burn list 
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 PM] but maybe that's just an assumption
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 PM] from when I hated Tom
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:56 PM] I was thinking about poeple who have been here a while being on the list 
[shane = new Shane();] [9:56 PM] there are some
[shane = new Shane();] [9:56 PM] where it's obvious they're just bitter old ex pats who've been here teaching too long
[shane = new Shane();] [9:57 PM] and they say awful hateful shit
[shane = new Shane();] [9:57 PM] usually on throwaway accounts
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:57 PM] I just like the posts on news and upcoming events
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:58 PM] I tend not to follow particular accounts 
[shane = new Shane();] [9:58 PM] I added specific accounts to friends when I knew they were in chat
[shane = new Shane();] [9:58 PM] so I can post stalk them 
[shane = new Shane();] [9:58 PM] but I don't know a lot
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] i only know yours and victorias
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] but i dont follow them
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] I dont have time for that
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] I got shit to read
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] knitting to do
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:59 PM] pooka to play with
[100% not Corrie] [10:00 PM] I post on r/korea sometimes
[100% not Corrie] [10:00 PM] I kind of worry because it's so fucking obvs it's me
[shane = new Shane();] [10:00 PM] I don't think I've posted there in over a year
[shane = new Shane();] [10:00 PM] like I posted once
[shane = new Shane();] [10:00 PM] for invite to group
[100% not Corrie] [10:00 PM] I've had a back and forth with freeseoul
[100% not Corrie] [10:00 PM] God I love that guy
[100% not Corrie] [10:00 PM] He's hilarious
[shane = new Shane();] [10:01 PM] I don't recognize these, I only know I hate koreathrowaway823823843 or whatever
[shane = new Shane();] [10:01 PM] and I'm still pretty sure it's Tom.
[100% not Corrie] [10:01 PM] Hahahahahahah
[100% not Corrie] [10:01 PM] I'm wondering who is in the chat, honestly
[100% not Corrie] [10:01 PM] Like that sub is such a cesspool sometimes
[100% not Corrie] [10:01 PM] Other times its interesting
[shane = new Shane();] [10:03 PM] I read /r/korean
[shane = new Shane();] [10:03 PM] but not /r/korea
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:04 PM] how are they differnt
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:04 PM] ive never been on r/korean
[shane = new Shane();] [10:06 PM] it's just language
[shane = new Shane();] [10:06 PM] not like a sister sub

[shane = new Shane();] [9:46 AM] the following transcript taken from a professional Magic: The Gathering tournament, which I typed up for my magic chat.
[shane = new Shane();] [9:46 AM] Riki Hayashi: (continuing on from Adrian's description of Shardless vs BUG Delver as two different types of Tarmogoyf decks) "Tarmogoyf STYLE, from Adrian Sullivan. Now I'm just imagining, like, oh! oh! oh! Tarmo Style!" mimicking 2012's 'Gangnam Style' released by Psy.
Adrian Sullivan: "... Oh, god." Chuckling slowly.
Riki Hayashi: "I'm so 6 months ago, I know. The new thing is the fox, right? I've watched it once, but I don't recall.
Adrian Sullivan laughs awkwardly.
Riki Hayashi: "Ding a ling a ling? Goes the fox? Is that it?"
Adrian Sullivan: "I couldn't tell you.. I couldn't make it through the video."
Riki Hayashi: "Gotta keep up with the kids, Adrian."
Adrian Sullivan: "Oh no, I watched it. I just couldn't finish it."
Riki Hayashi: "Ok, well we're gonna FINISH, this match, momentarily."
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:52 AM] what does the fox say?
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 AM] I actually don't know
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 AM] I know it was a song but I'm unsure if I heard it
[shane = new Shane();] [9:55 AM] and I didn't go search out the video
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:56 AM] I heard it from kids here and at a baseball game
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:56 AM] never heard it in the states
[shane = new Shane();] [10:10 AM] what do you guys think about dudes who wear rings on their fingers

[shane = new Shane();] [10:45 AM] photo

[100% not Corrie] [1:13 PM] They're becoming aware
[100% not Corrie] [3:44 PM] Sup ya'll, fam been quiet today
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 PM] i was just about to message
[100% not Corrie] [3:44 PM] I could use a massage
[100% not Corrie] [3:44 PM] I'll accept
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 PM] because i spent all day working coding a script to automatically translate our korean named functions to english
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 PM] and look
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:44 PM] overall, it went really well
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] but there are a few noteworthy exceptions
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] mostly, the module 수수_판별
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] which means "prime number indentification"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] was translated to
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 PM] Soosoo~~~ Sudeo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] niceyu
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:45 PM] niceu
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] *소수
[100% not Corrie] [3:46 PM] I need to program. I've been "learning" for two years now and I can barely write anything
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] anyway ,after a database update it became
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] photo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] MinorityDiscrimination
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] ...
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] hahahahahhahahaha
[100% not Corrie] [3:46 PM] hahahaha\
[100% not Corrie] [3:46 PM] niceu
[100% not Corrie] [3:46 PM] You know how I started with python?
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 PM] It was comforting to me. My first language
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 PM] I took a break because I got to classes in it and that broke my mind...
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 PM] Eventually went through webdev stufffffff
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 PM] And wrapped back around to java
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] webdeb stuff doesn't use a lot of classes
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] iirc
[100% not Corrie] [3:47 PM] And I like it. 
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] (i don't do web dev)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] yeah then do that
[100% not Corrie] [3:48 PM] I then went and tried to redo class shit in python
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:48 PM] and it was easier??!?!?!
[100% not Corrie] [3:48 PM] and was like "Ah, why didn't I understand this before"
[100% not Corrie] [3:48 PM] But, new problem
[100% not Corrie] [3:48 PM] python gives me the anxiety something fierce
[100% not Corrie] [3:48 PM] Everything seems unfinished.
[100% not Corrie] [3:49 PM] I described it to my friend as buying a gundam model and cutting all the pieces out, dumping them in a pile, then trying to put it together based ont he instructions
[100% not Corrie] [3:49 PM] like "Oh... where the fuck is C-1? Eh, this is C-1 now."
[100% not Corrie] [3:55 PM] Victoria likes to discriminate against minorities.
[100% not Corrie] [4:34 PM] Hey ya'll, Korea still blacklisty about mental health issues? 
[shane = new Shane();] [5:00 PM] uh
[shane = new Shane();] [5:00 PM] I'd say it would be unsafe and unwise to mention anything about counseling or therapy or anything for any reason ever
[100% not Corrie] [5:02 PM] I mean mentioning it is one thing, why would anyone advertise something like that to their employer. 
[shane = new Shane();] [5:02 PM] well
[shane = new Shane();] [5:03 PM] from what I've heard
[100% not Corrie] [5:03 PM] I mean, if I just go talk to a psychologist, for whatever reason, unspecified, would that in some way blacklist me?
[shane = new Shane();] [5:03 PM] Someone told me this anecdote
[shane = new Shane();] [5:03 PM] Dude tells the principal he's feeling under the weather, he's got an ear infection or something. He wants to take the afternoon to go to the doctor.
[shane = new Shane();] [5:04 PM] Co-teacher asks how the appointment went and the guy's like "why the hell would the boss tell the other employees even why I went to the doctor?"
[shane = new Shane();] [5:05 PM] something something something turns out boss called the hospital to make sure the foreigner went and to ask why and what was wrong with them
[100% not Corrie] [5:07 PM] Ah. Cool. Nice. Great job.
[shane = new Shane();] [5:07 PM] 1) make sure your employer isn't just making excuses to get out of work and that they went to the doctor like they said
2) make sure they're not crazy and they didn't go to the doctor for mental problems
[100% not Corrie] [5:07 PM] So in the hypothetical situation I wanted to maintain any privacy whatsoever about anything, never tell a soul about anything.
[shane = new Shane();] [5:07 PM] Yes.
[shane = new Shane();] [5:08 PM] typo in 1), I meant employee*
[100% not Corrie] [5:08 PM] I got your meaning
[Victoria (Gelb)] [5:18 PM] photo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [5:18 PM] obama for president, all years

[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] i was drinking whisky with the climate change dude
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] good whisky too because i ordered a cheaper one i usually don't drink, but apparently they only had half a glass left
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] so they gave me a free whisky of my choice!
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] anyway what was i talking about
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] man
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] isn't whisky great

[100% not Corrie] [9:24 PM] Greetings, everyone. I am new. (One second – let me get this spork out of the
way.) My name is Katy, but you can call me the Penguin of Doom. (I’m laughing 
aloud.) As you can plainly see, my actions have no pattern whatsoever. That is
why I have come here. To meet similarly patternless individuals, such as myself.

I am 13 – mature for my age, however! – and I enjoy watching Invader Zim 
with my girlfriend. (I am bisexual. Please approach this subject maturely.)
It is our favorite television show, as it adequately displays stochastic 
manners of behavior such as we possess.

She behaves without order – of course – but I wish to meet more individuals
of her and my kind. As the saying goes, “the more, the merrier.”

Ah, it is to laugh. Anyway, I hope to make many friends here, so please 
comment freely.

Doom!

That is simply one of many examples of my random actions. Ha, ha. Fare 
thee well. I wish you much love and waffles.

Yours,

[100% not Corrie] [11:22 AM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [11:52 AM] johnny_picotte: soo... hows your schedule look for a trip to Thailand?
shanepeil: can they afford me
johnny_picotte: don't know.. ticket 238296
shanepeil: is this the one you emailed Duckkyu about? He doesn't and wouldn't know about where the Verde went after CD Data demo
johnny_picotte: yup
shanepeil: Just looked at Suman's consult - looks good, these steps would work fine to follow on site
shanepeil: I doubt they will want to send anyone from support for an eval library though
johnny_picotte: per the consult with Alan.. We do need someone on site to perform a USB reimage  and Suman's notes state to work with you on it.
shanepeil: I'm happy to help
shanepeil: but they're going to have to do it, like I said I can't just send myself over there
johnny_picotte: yeah.. I have Ben working on that
johnny_picotte: besides.. we wouldn't get you out of the massage parlors 
shanepeil: never been to thailand
shanepeil: seems cool
johnny_picotte: aye.. they are famous for their massage parlors
johnny_picotte: and red light districts
johnny_picotte's status is now "Idle". (8/5/2016 11:48 AM)

shanepeil: that's nice
[shane = new Shane();] [11:52 AM] I guess I could have trimmed that quote a little bit because there's work shit in there that's unnecessary
[shane = new Shane();] [11:52 AM] but jesus christ johnny
[100% not Corrie] [11:55 AM] Is he heavily implying that you'd be too preoccupied with prostitutes to get anything done? =l
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:05 PM] johnny wasn't the old dude, right
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:05 PM] the one me and jackie met
[shane = new Shane();] [12:24 PM] not him
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:26 PM] so corrie fam, you coming next weekend for sure?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:27 PM] (emoticon)

[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:07 PM] https://www.instagram.com/xomissdanielle/?hl=en
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:07 PM] i'm in love
[100% not Corrie] [2:08 PM] You and me both
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:18 PM] she is like a even hotter karen gilliam
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:18 PM] it's insane
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:18 PM] *gillan
[100% not Corrie] [2:18 PM] ..Gillan
[100% not Corrie] [2:18 PM] For SHAME
[100% not Corrie] [2:19 PM] I'm bored.
[100% not Corrie] [2:19 PM] Bored. Bored. Bored.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:19 PM] friday is debug day
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:19 PM] i hate debug day
[100% not Corrie] [2:20 PM] Better than bug day
[100% not Corrie] [2:20 PM] Which would suck worse
[100% not Corrie] [2:20 PM] Thursday is bug day. It's when your company let's me in and I dick around with all your code in preparation for debug Friday
[100% not Corrie] [2:20 PM] You're welcome
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:21 PM] "This is Corrie. He brings bugs."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:21 PM] "Does he have crabs?"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:21 PM] "Yes."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:21 PM] "No further questions"
[100% not Corrie] [2:21 PM] "Crabs are not bugs. Crabs are crustaceans."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:22 PM] "Crabs are like the bugs of the sea."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:22 PM] "If tuna is the chicken of the sea, then crabs are the bugs of the sea."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:22 PM] at this point
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:22 PM] everyone has left the meeting room
[100% not Corrie] [2:23 PM] "The value of simile is lost on many people."
[100% not Corrie] [2:23 PM] Just me and you sitting in a room alone trying to out-pedant one another
[100% not Corrie] [2:23 PM] God is Love. Love is blind. Ray Charles is blind. Ray Charles is God.
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:24 PM] mfw mofos confuse => with <=>
[100% not Corrie] [2:24 PM] lol
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:24 PM] (emoticon)
[100% not Corrie] [2:24 PM] Fucking formal logic
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] Gets me every fucking time
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] When I ask how to say "or" in korean
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] And they throw fucking "animyeon" at me
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] "x if not y" is not the same as "x or y"
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] Unless I'm over thinking Korean
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:32 PM] you can also say (이)나
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:32 PM] or 거나
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:32 PM] depending on situation
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:32 PM] like
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:32 PM] 오늘 뭐 먹을래?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:33 PM] 갈비나 밥 먹자
[shane = new Shane();] [2:33 PM] (이)나 for nouns and 거나 for verbs
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:33 PM] exactly
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:34 PM] shane is so pro
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:34 PM] 시간이 있으면 수영하거나 책을 읽기를 좋아해
[100% not Corrie] [2:35 PM] oh! Cool! Thanks\
[shane = new Shane();] [2:35 PM] ahhh I like this  있으면 ending
[shane = new Shane();] [2:35 PM] I didn't know that
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:35 PM] if!
[shane = new Shane();] [2:35 PM] like "if there is"
[shane = new Shane();] [2:35 PM] ?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:35 PM] Yep!
[100% not Corrie] [2:35 PM] Yup
[shane = new Shane();] [2:35 PM] swimming OR reading a book (hah, GAY)
[100% not Corrie] [2:35 PM] Like "If you have time"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:35 PM] hahahahahhahaha
[100% not Corrie] [2:36 PM] 시간이 있으면 맥주 마실래요?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:36 PM] no
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:36 PM] GAYYYYYYY
[100% not Corrie] [2:36 PM] ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
[shane = new Shane();] [2:36 PM] Sure cori
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:36 PM] ha
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:36 PM] GAYYYYYYYYYY
[shane = new Shane();] [2:36 PM] fuck off
[shane = new Shane();] [2:36 PM] corrie
[shane = new Shane();] [2:37 PM] who doesn't have time for a mekju
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:37 PM] i really really like setting up clauses in korean
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:37 PM] because they give me more time to think of what to say
[shane = new Shane();] [2:37 PM] one more time unit
[100% not Corrie] [2:37 PM] I'm clause crazy in Korean, fucking korean is clausegasmic
[100% not Corrie] [2:37 PM] Though, speaking is problematic
[100% not Corrie] [2:37 PM] Writing is fun
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:37 PM] i can pause after i say "있으먼" or "어렸을때"
[100% not Corrie] [2:38 PM] I have a particular way of speaking in English where I hold off on a lot of details until the end of what I'm saying to maximize the impact.... it's a bad habit
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:38 PM] or even after using locative prepositional phrases like "자동차에" 
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:38 PM] no
[100% not Corrie] [2:38 PM] But that's nearly impossible in Korean
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:38 PM] that doesn't sound abd
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:38 PM] *bad
[100% not Corrie] [2:38 PM] I mince words/mitigate social pressure in odd ways
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:39 PM] I think you are exceedingly eloquent
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:40 PM] a lot of things you said when we were in daegu (the points you made about certain topics) still stick with me
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:40 PM] mostly
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:40 PM] what you said about korean girls being into western men
[100% not Corrie] [2:41 PM] Thanks, I appreciate the sentiment, honestly. Like I said before, some people, still, as an adult, "pick on me" for how I speak
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:41 PM] how gender equality is largely a western phenomenon and fairly new, so dating a western man allows them more freedom in their relationship
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:41 PM] i like that idea a lot
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:41 PM] how i feel about people picking on you is this":
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:41 PM] it's great because you SUCK
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:41 PM] no how i feel is
[100% not Corrie] [2:41 PM] Broad strokes paint broad pictures, but it's been of interest to some sociologists 
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:42 PM] it's a bunch of english majors feeling the need to validate their degrees by jumping down the throats of others with less-than-precise word choice
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:42 PM] to put it in perspective
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] no one in my company (all tech people) makes fun of my word choice
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] in fact, they usually make fun of me for using words they don't even know
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] (they are americans)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] so
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] I appreciate you
[shane = new Shane();] [2:43 PM] gay
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:43 PM] i appreciate you too
[shane = new Shane();] [2:44 PM] really ga
[shane = new Shane();] [2:44 PM] y
[100% not Corrie] [2:44 PM] I've never really thought about it based on their majors.
[100% not Corrie] [2:44 PM] My interests are pretty... fucking scattered... so the way I speak is pretty... fucking scattered
[100% not Corrie] [2:44 PM] I like picking up new words. I like being precise. I like hearing words that sound good together.
[100% not Corrie] [2:45 PM] Which is one of the reasons I can talk the talk with a lot of people outside my fields. I can pick up on the jargon quick enough, I just wanna conversate haha
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] I think we don't pick on each other here. I personally don't like messaging other ESL teachers because when I communicate with friends I don't think about grammar
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] i think about how awesome my friends are
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] whom who
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] doesn't matter
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] this is chat
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:54 PM] no picking on or correcting. this isn't an interview
[100% not Corrie] [3:55 PM] I mean, picking on each other here is fine :P because we're just joking, we're already friends
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:55 PM] this is a free spave5
[100% not Corrie] [3:55 PM] But there's a big difference between one of ya'll calling me out for a big word
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:55 PM] space
[100% not Corrie] [3:55 PM] And someone just trying to make fun of me for the same thing
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:00 PM] Jason Momoa, Ladies and Gentleman  - Jason Momoa, Ladies and Gentleman  https://imgur.com/gallery/DQ12rEa
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:00 PM] I've made fun of aqua man a lot in my life
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:00 PM] but I might take back everything is said
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:01 PM] only reason to see the movie is that man
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] he is perfect
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] his face, his eyebrows, his body
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] goddamnit jacky
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] *jackie
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] GODDAMNIT VICTORIA FOR MISPELLING JACKIE
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] it is so hard having two jacky/ies in my life
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:12 PM] but you only have a hat for the best one
[shane = new Shane();] [4:24 PM] guys I did it, I successfully didn't eat garbage today
[shane = new Shane();] [4:25 PM] however I did smoke like 7 cigarettes last night and passed out drinking makers mark by myself
[shane = new Shane();] [4:25 PM] photo
[shane = new Shane();] [4:25 PM] ATONEMENT
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:25 PM] that looks delicious.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:26 PM] why did you smoke so much
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:26 PM] and not share makers mark
[shane = new Shane();] [4:26 PM] yo so I walked to the woori mart and got plain lo-fat yogurt
[shane = new Shane();] [4:26 PM] and a huge ass bag of granola (only 10k wtf?)
[shane = new Shane();] [4:26 PM] and some bananas and grapes and shit and now I'm only allowed to eat that, ok
[shane = new Shane();] [4:26 PM] idk I had class last night right and then in the middle of it I started just feeling really sad
[shane = new Shane();] [4:27 PM] So I went for a drink and while I was drinking it I got like REALLY sad
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:27 PM] (emoticon)
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:27 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [4:27 PM] So I bought a pack of smokes and smoked them rebelliously not even enjoying them
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:27 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [4:27 PM] And don't worry I got maker's left
[shane = new Shane();] [4:27 PM] I didn't kill it or nothing
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:28 PM] Well don't be sad..genies night tonight?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:28 PM] being sad is lame

[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:17 PM] why aren't stations air conditioned
[100% not Corrie] [12:18 PM] Dunno. Most don't even have fans. It's just ambient cooling from being downstairs/wind from the trains
[100% not Corrie] [12:18 PM] It's usually super uncomfortable waiting for a train, but then the trains are nice and icey
[100% not Corrie] [12:18 PM] The big central station is airconditioned because there's a shopping center around it

[100% not Corrie] [2:05 PM] Except you can type quotation marks
[100% not Corrie] [2:05 PM] So I don't even
[shane = new Shane();] [2:06 PM] depends on the feel of the post
[shane = new Shane();] [2:06 PM] whether I capitalize or stubbornly refuse to as a stylistic choicrt
[shane = new Shane();] [2:06 PM] choice
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:21 PM] I actually associate not capitalizing anything with Shane

[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:20 AM] ya
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:20 AM] I think I've heard this theory actually
[100% not Corrie] [12:20 AM] But when they got Avengers 2,people complained about it being too similar to the first or some shit
[100% not Corrie] [12:21 AM] Like... Avengers one was game changing for comic book movies
[100% not Corrie] [12:21 AM] But you can't get change with every goddamn film.
[100% not Corrie] [12:21 AM] *game change

[shane = new Shane();] [5:52 PM] which is me losing a few hundred dollars on what happened but

[100% not Corrie] [5:59 PM] Nice Shane!
[shane = new Shane();] [5:59 PM] im definitely going to go out and parkour
[shane = new Shane();] [6:01 PM] to celebrate me being such a dumb fuck initially
[shane = new Shane();] [6:01 PM] that I actually managed to seriously injure myself with no recollection of how
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:06 PM] that was a weird night in general
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:06 PM] that white guy kept touching my ass
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:07 PM] you almost lost the use of your legs
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:07 PM] john got laid
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:07 PM] overall, a very uncharacteristic night
[shane = new Shane();] [6:09 PM] omg John got SO laid
[shane = new Shane();] [6:09 PM] making out with an ugly girl in the middle of Sam Ryan's like a champ
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:10 PM] she wasn't that ugly
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:10 PM] you know how in america, any asian girl is automatically a 6
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:10 PM] at least
[100% not Corrie] [6:10 PM] Not some of them I'VE seen
[100% not Corrie] [6:10 PM] Or maybe that's just from living in Asia
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:10 PM] exactly
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:11 PM] i remember how mediocre looking asian chicks were always considered "so hot"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:11 PM] and now i think
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] asian girls are not automatically 6's
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:11 PM] if people like grace or actually gorgeous koreans were in america
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] I do remember how some guys seemed to think asian 6s were 8s
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:11 PM] people would fall over themselves
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] grace is hot as hell
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] anyways
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:11 PM] i bet grace got mad hit on in uni
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] anyway
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] the girl john was hitting on was a straight up 5
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:12 PM] 그러데 잘했어
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] hahahahaha
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:12 PM] *그런데
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] the thing with korean girls is that
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:12 PM] but john is like a -8
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] you come here
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] and all of the sudden
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] 30% of people are not obese
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:12 PM] THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
[shane = new Shane();] [6:12 PM] and 30% of the people on top of that are not just "overweight"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:13 PM] i think we've had this discussion before, and i agree 100%
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:13 PM] so you come here, and it's like sensory overload
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:13 PM] from all the hotties
[shane = new Shane();] [6:13 PM] then you've got this culture that pushes make up and a decent outfit at ALL times
[shane = new Shane();] [6:14 PM] and you end up just seeing more bangables per squre inch
[shane = new Shane();] [6:14 PM] square
[shane = new Shane();] [6:14 PM] fuck, hit insert key
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:17 PM] fuck the insert key
[shane = new Shane();] [6:17 PM] no one uses that bullshit
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:17 PM] IT'S THE WORST
[shane = new Shane();] [6:17 PM] all it does is fuck ppl up when they accidentally hit it at some point
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:17 PM] it's like people who program using backspace to go back in on a page
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:18 PM] if you have a website that has a contains a fillable form but also has the ability to use backspace to go back to the previous page
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:18 PM] you are the demons and i hate you
[shane = new Shane();] [6:19 PM] yap
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:22 PM] Google docs has that feature
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:22 PM] I hate it
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:22 PM] it shouldn't have that feature when you do nothing but type
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:22 PM] lucky the autosaves
[100% not Corrie] [6:32 PM] Actually, it's funny, because I knew a lot of Korean girls in university who I was convinced were 7+'s 
[100% not Corrie] [6:32 PM] And I know them now
[100% not Corrie] [6:32 PM] In Korea
[100% not Corrie] [6:34 PM] They are not Korean 7+'s
[100% not Corrie] [6:34 PM] Lol
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:39 PM] Korean girls cant compare to korean girls
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:40 PM] its a rough place to live as a non korean girl looking at korean girls
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] [공지] Korean girls cant compare to korean girls
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:41 PM] it is rough but at the same time, no one is actively comparing me to them
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:41 PM] i feel
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:41 PM] i don't worry about having to be as skinny or as put together or as makeup or surgery-y as them because i'm not korean?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:41 PM] or maybe i do i dont' know
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:52 PM] im trying to jazz up firm tofu
[100% not Corrie] [6:53 PM] I haven't had a good tofu dish in forever...
[100% not Corrie] [6:53 PM] I want tofu curry something fierce, maaaaaaaaaaan
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:53 PM] marinate in soy sauce, sesame oil 
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:53 PM] fry it 
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:53 PM] im working with what i got
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:54 PM] I have onions i may fry in the pan first to add flavor
[Victoria (Gelb)] [7:19 PM] dry and press it with paper towels before you marinate it!
[Victoria (Gelb)] [7:19 PM] sorry you probably know this
[Victoria (Gelb)] [7:19 PM] but tofu is my jam
[shane = new Shane();] [7:20 PM] you're not supposed to put jam on.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [7:36 PM] I didnt do that
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [7:37 PM] I added to much soy sauce
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [7:37 PM] my apartment smells of soy sauce
[shane = new Shane();] [7:37 PM] is it assalting your senses
[100% not Corrie] [7:43 PM] there's no such thing as too much soy sauce
[100% not Corrie] [7:43 PM] soy sauce is love
[100% not Corrie] [7:43 PM] soy sauce is life
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [8:04 PM] soy sauce is stronger than fabreze

[100% not Corrie] [9:02 PM] Dose feels when the lotteria cashier instantly starts to take out a menu for you to jab a finger at what you want.... Before she realizes you're ordering in Korean already.
[100% not Corrie] [9:03 PM] And her face instantly goes from "goddamn foreigner making me use English" to "Oh shit, I'm at work"
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:03 PM] I get the look of fear a lot since my korean is awful
[100% not Corrie] [9:04 PM] photo

[shane = new Shane();] [1:09 AM] written by corrie, 2009
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 AM] Fuck, you saw through it
[shane = new Shane();] [8:48 AM] very late at night I posted a link to a reddit thread where a girl posted a very long story about how she gave BJ's to every friend her brother brought over when they were teens
[shane = new Shane();] [8:48 AM] then she said it was because she was autistic
[shane = new Shane();] [8:49 AM] I thought this was amusing in a bizarre way so I posted it but no one replied except meggie cuz they were all asleep
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 AM] and meggie just wrote like typical meggie shit
[100% not Corrie] [9:18 AM] Well... TBF... You wrote "fucking aspies", not just posted it.
[100% not Corrie] [9:18 AM] Is meggie autistic? What was with her reply?
[shane = new Shane();] [9:28 AM] shes not autistic she's just attention seeking
[100% not Corrie] [9:29 AM] Ah
[100% not Corrie] [9:29 AM] Weird
[shane = new Shane();] [9:29 AM] if there's ever a space for her to say something negative about herself she'll take it in hopes that someone will say something nice
[100% not Corrie] [9:29 AM] Everyone was kinda touchy in the chat from what I was reading
[100% not Corrie] [9:30 AM] Ah, great, now I'm gonna notice it, like my breathing or the feeling of having a tongue
[shane = new Shane();] [9:31 AM] I was really rude to dan for no reason

[shane = new Shane();] [1:30 PM] what happened with the Q&A guy
[shane = new Shane();] [1:30 PM] Also you owed us this story like 2 hours ago
[shane = new Shane();] [1:30 PM] so I don't even really feel bad
[shane = new Shane();] [1:30 PM] About jerkin you like this
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:31 PM] i know but i was doing other thangs
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:31 PM] well he was answering questions
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:31 PM] and i was sitting next to homer and was riffing on the ceo's answers because he's kind of a butt
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] Somebody like brown-nosey asked him about his biggest fears for the company, but worded it "What keeps you up at night?"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] And I was like "The screaming. Oh god, the screaming"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] And Homer lost it and everyone looked at us
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] ANYWAY
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] that isn't the story
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:32 PM] that's just me being funny
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:33 PM] classic me
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:33 PM] i lost my train of thought
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:33 PM] someone help
[shane = new Shane();] [1:33 PM] isnt it though
[shane = new Shane();] [1:33 PM] how did you enact a plan
[shane = new Shane();] [1:33 PM] that will save the company
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:33 PM] not save the company, but
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:33 PM] we have this thing i told you about - these refresh days where we spend money and everyone goes on various outings as a company
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:34 PM] but as you all know, my company just flat out didn't pay me a couple months ago because they mismanaged their funding towards the end of the funding period
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:34 PM] for the few months before that, we didn't have refresh days (things like going bowling, going to the zoo, etc.)
[shane = new Shane();] [1:34 PM] so the company some times spends its money frivolously
[shane = new Shane();] [1:34 PM] and then forgets to pay their employees
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:34 PM] yep
[shane = new Shane();] [1:34 PM] yep, got it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:34 PM] so I said as much
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:35 PM] because the moment we entered the new funding period, refresh day started again
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:36 PM] so I asked them "What exactly is the point of refresh day? Whenever I ask, I get these vague aphorisms like 'The company that plays together, stays together' or that it 'encourages bonding."  But the fact still remains that if we were strapped for cash and we decided to NOT have them, their cost has a palpable effect on our company. Monthly."
[100% not Corrie] [1:37 PM] Woah tiger
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:37 PM] no it was awesome because
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:37 PM] there was like a silence after i said it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:37 PM] and then loads of people were like "yeah"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:38 PM] people i've never even talked to were like "why do we do this, we're busy and we're a startup. we should be making sure we manage and don't spend money onhings we don't absolutely need"
[shane = new Shane();] [1:39 PM] nice one dude
[shane = new Shane();] [1:39 PM] except i totally miss Zoo days
[shane = new Shane();] [1:39 PM] you suck
[shane = new Shane();] [1:39 PM] you suck forever
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:40 PM] ZOO DAY WAS THE WORST
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:40 PM] zoo day was the day we had a scavenger hunt at the zoo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:41 PM] so nobody was looking at the animals because we were all looking for clues hidden over this huge fucking zoo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:41 PM] and when i was looking for clues (pieces of paper), i thought i found one and picked it up
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:41 PM] but it was just a huge pad
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:41 PM] (feminine pad)
[shane = new Shane();] [1:42 PM] no fucking way
[shane = new Shane();] [1:42 PM] that is so groady

[100% not Corrie] [7:26 PM] Feel like shit. Hot as hell. One class exploded. Another class was just absolutely abysmal. Annoyed at life and the future. Impatient to be out of this job.
[100% not Corrie] [7:26 PM] The usual.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [7:28 PM] (emoticon)I totally understand.  Everyone has those days.
[100% not Corrie] [7:37 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [7:52 PM] sorry mang
[shane = new Shane();] [7:59 PM] eat a sandwich and count your blessings that you don't wake up to urgent emails from Thailand every day
[shane = new Shane();] [8:03 PM] I had a really good class today
[100% not Corrie] [8:07 PM] Maaan, I wish I had a sandwich
[100% not Corrie] [8:07 PM] A sandwich would make life a modicum better
[100% not Corrie] [8:07 PM] Good to hear, yo, you learnin' lots?
[shane = new Shane();] [8:09 PM] im doing better and reading and answering questions faster
[shane = new Shane();] [8:09 PM] idk

[100% not Corrie] [8:29 PM] Woo, retard level UNITE
[shane = new Shane();] [8:33 PM] your korean stronger than mine
[shane = new Shane();] [8:33 PM] you can have dummy level
[100% not Corrie] [8:38 PM] I thought your Korean level was well above mine o.O
[shane = new Shane();] [8:38 PM] you said that last time and idk how you assumed that
[shane = new Shane();] [8:38 PM] I dont know anything
[100% not Corrie] [8:41 PM] Ah. Dunno why I was under that impression
[100% not Corrie] [8:41 PM] Oh well
[100% not Corrie] [8:41 PM] lol
[100% not Corrie] [8:41 PM] I'll take the dummy level then~ WOOOOOOOOOO~
[Victoria (Gelb)] [8:43 PM] (emoticon)
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [8:46 PM] you are all better than me
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [8:47 PM] I can understand what'd going on and can never reply
[100% not Corrie] [8:48 PM] My biggest tool is the fact that I've spent years talking to my mother who has aphasia
[100% not Corrie] [8:48 PM] Since she literally CANNOT make sense 98% of the time
[100% not Corrie] [8:48 PM] I had to become really, REALLY good at anticipating what someone is trying to say
[100% not Corrie] [8:49 PM] Body language, situational context, knowing the person and how they behave
[100% not Corrie] [8:49 PM] That and languages are like my idiot savant aspie power
[shane = new Shane();] [8:49 PM] im sorry jackie
[shane = new Shane();] [8:49 PM] we don't mean to use secret language in here

[100% not Corrie] [8:50 PM] ^
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [8:50 PM] I dont read it very well but my korean dramas and students have taught me a thing or two
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 PM] I feel like I study a lot
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 PM] and when ppl talk to me im like well fuck
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 PM] what was that
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 PM] just nod
[100% not Corrie] [8:50 PM] It sucks because kids are just naturally more perceptive
[shane = new Shane();] [8:50 PM] the girls at the cage I go to now are convinced im fluent
[100% not Corrie] [8:50 PM] I can have a full on, super in depth convo with a kid
[100% not Corrie] [8:51 PM] And they PERFECTLY understand me
[shane = new Shane();] [8:51 PM] from what I've said earlier

[shane = new Shane();] [9:05 PM] alcohol only makes me upset now
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:13 PM] Oh no. Is it because you are alone? 
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:13 PM] I dont like drinking alone because i either dance by myself or get sad
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [9:13 PM] but now i kinda wanna dance to my new soundtrack

[shane = new Shane();] [9:24 PM] 잘했어
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] mead
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] mead
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] when we are doing this mead
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] also I ducking failed at my first coldbrew
[100% not Corrie] [9:26 PM] I want mead =(
[100% not Corrie] [9:26 PM] Am I fam enough for fammead?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] why yes
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:26 PM] I believe you are
[100% not Corrie] [9:27 PM] (emoticon)
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:28 PM] come drink with us
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:28 PM] so we can have our mead soon
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:28 PM] imMEADiately
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:28 PM] if you will
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:28 PM] ...will you?
[100% not Corrie] [9:28 PM] I'm in mead of a drink
[100% not Corrie] [9:28 PM] Me?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:29 PM] little ole mead
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:29 PM] I already called named it "ReMEAD-i-ALE elixir"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:29 PM] it will cure what ales ya
[100% not Corrie] [9:30 PM] I'm a mead connoisseur~
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:35 PM] wait are you really
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:35 PM] if so
[Victoria (Gelb)] [9:35 PM] you probably dont want any of my mead
[100% not Corrie] [9:36 PM] Haha I'm just a guy who really loves mead. I've drank mead from all over Europe and the US
[100% not Corrie] [9:36 PM] As long as it's made of honey and gets me drunk
[100% not Corrie] [9:36 PM] I'm fine with it.
[shane = new Shane();] [10:04 PM] mead in my experience has been sickly sweet and gives a wicked hangover
[shane = new Shane();] [10:04 PM] like victoria herself
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:06 PM] that's just, like, your opinion man
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:07 PM] well if it helps I am pretty sure I put way too much yeast in it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:07 PM] so we'll all either get blackout or double in size if left covered in a warm area for 30 minutes
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:10 PM] so mosquitoes update
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:11 PM] genetically modified mosquitoes will be released on Florida and will fight zika mosquitoes
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:11 PM] !!!
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:11 PM] but will these ones still bite people?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:12 PM] Yeah but they contact a deadly gene the they pass off to offspring
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:12 PM] the offspring are infertile and will die
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:12 PM] pass on to
[shane = new Shane();] [10:18 PM] so this is the modification they tested on mosquitos a few years ago and proved that they could eradicate them right
[shane = new Shane();] [10:19 PM] but there are lots of concerns about what happens after that, like are mosquitos a valuable and necessary part of the ecosystem?
[shane = new Shane();] [10:20 PM] personally I think we can just nuke them and deal with the aftermath later because it's unlikely it matters. lots of animals that eat skeeters will eat something else instead
[shane = new Shane();] [10:20 PM] but there are ethical questions
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:31 PM] they help pollination
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:32 PM] and are food to some fish and birds
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:32 PM] I vote save the bees
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:34 PM] ecosystems are so delicate, it is impossible to know what eradicating an entkre population would do
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:34 PM] there is a specific example, hold on
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:34 PM] also jackie, I was JUST reading an article today about how they now know that widespread bee populations dwindling is not the result of pesticides
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:35 PM] and is the direct result of climate change and bees (unlike other animals) failing to migrate north to cooler temperatures
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:37 PM]  poor bees. they are gonna die with polar bears
[shane = new Shane();] [10:39 PM] so we have to just sort our recyclables
[shane = new Shane();] [10:39 PM] rigjt
[Victoria (Gelb)] [10:39 PM] ^this guy fucks
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:42 PM] be like sweden. they are so good at recycling the import garbage into their country to use
[shane = new Shane();] [10:44 PM] did you read that on the internet or something because
[shane = new Shane();] [10:44 PM] im not sure I believe that
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:49 PM] I did read it on the internet
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:49 PM] I read everything on the internet
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [10:49 PM] Internet is life
[shane = new Shane();] [11:46 PM] hmm
[shane = new Shane();] [11:46 PM] (emoticon)

[100% not Corrie] [12:10 PM] No, they don't look like tomatoes
[100% not Corrie] [12:10 PM] They look like peaches. Are they just peaches?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:12 PM] nah dude, p sure those are apricots
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:12 PM] omg now i want persimmons

[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:13 PM] photo
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:13 PM] mmm
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:13 PM] buttplugs
[shane = new Shane();] [12:14 PM] they aren't persimmons or apricots
[shane = new Shane();] [12:14 PM] persimmons are ugly
[shane = new Shane();] [12:14 PM] and apricots are fuzzy
[shane = new Shane();] [12:14 PM] the inside looks like an orange plum
[shane = new Shane();] [12:20 PM] like i would take a picture but I already ate two today
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:24 PM] just ask michele because she likes fruits and hiking
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:25 PM] it's just a korean plum
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:25 PM] you were right
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:25 PM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [12:26 PM] Looks more like a nectarine
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:27 PM] nah, i trust michele, she eats fruits and nuts and hikes large hills
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:29 PM] Michele is cool
[shane = new Shane();] [12:31 PM] yeah I had come to the conclusion that it was just a plum
[shane = new Shane();] [12:31 PM] it's ok, I cut them up and put them in yogurt anyway
[shane = new Shane();] [12:32 PM] which worked even though that's not what plums are for
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:34 PM] what are plums for
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:34 PM] please tell me
[shane = new Shane();] [12:38 PM] eating whole
[shane = new Shane();] [12:38 PM] not cutting up to put in other stuff because it had liquid
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:38 PM] eating whole
[Victoria (Gelb)] [12:38 PM] #assplay
[shane = new Shane();] [12:38 PM] and it touched the yogurt with its plum water
[shane = new Shane();] [12:39 PM] and it kind of skeeved me out
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 PM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 PM] Any idea where I can purchase stuff like this?
[shane = new Shane();] [1:10 PM] a 10 foot tall pillar filled with rice?
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 PM] That's coffee beans
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 PM] Also, no, the artwork
[100% not Corrie] [1:11 PM] With kitschy sayings like "clarity, hope, love" in Korean
[shane = new Shane();] [1:11 PM] no sorry
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:14 PM] you could paint one!
[100% not Corrie] [1:15 PM] I could also paint you like one of my French girls
[100% not Corrie] [1:15 PM] But neither would end up positively
[shane = new Shane();] [1:18 PM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [1:18 PM] .....??
[Victoria (Gelb)] [1:18 PM] photo
[shane = new Shane();] [1:18 PM] mfw corrie painting me

[shane = new Shane();] [2:54 PM] im lucky to be here
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] Maaaaaaaaaaan old Korean men... I don't know why the stereotype is that Asian women can't drive when it's old Asian men who drive like there's literally no one else k  the road
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] *on the road
[shane = new Shane();] [3:30 PM] I know why Asian women have the stereotype...
[shane = new Shane();] [3:30 PM] first hand in the US like
[shane = new Shane();] [3:30 PM] a lot
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:35 PM] I'm looking at recommend instagram pics cause I'm bored
[shane = new Shane();] [3:35 PM] whats recommended
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:35 PM] photo
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:35 PM] she's mixed in to my tattoos, vintage and beards
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:35 PM] how does she have so many followers
[shane = new Shane();] [3:36 PM] she appears to be 11 and a social media celebrity
[shane = new Shane();] [3:36 PM] jesus.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:37 PM] I think she's on nick
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:37 PM] maybe
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:37 PM] I stopped looking. I didn't want to creep on a child
[shane = new Shane();] [3:38 PM] overheard
[shane = new Shane();] [3:38 PM] 2 old men talking about VPN
[shane = new Shane();] [3:39 PM] 'im not sure what VPN stands for but you need it to download stuff that's blocked here'
[shane = new Shane();] [3:39 PM] I did not interject
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:44 PM] can you show me how you were able to do US netflix
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:45 PM] using a VPN caused the site not to play the videos
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 PM] You were using a free vpn
[100% not Corrie] [3:45 PM] Free VPN just don't have the same quality as a paid VPN
[shane = new Shane();] [3:46 PM] I have a paid VPN but also
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:46 PM] no I paid for mine
[shane = new Shane();] [3:46 PM] I just used hola Web plugin
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:46 PM] hide my ass
[shane = new Shane();] [3:46 PM] and it asks which country Netflix you want
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:46 PM] i use hidemyass too
[shane = new Shane();] [3:46 PM] when you go to the site. that said, Netflix has been working on blocking stuff
[shane = new Shane();] [3:47 PM] so I can't guarantee it still works
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] hidemyass has a A+ script for linux
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] wait
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:47 PM] no one cares~
[shane = new Shane();] [3:49 PM] I use some other shit
[shane = new Shane();] [3:49 PM] thats expensive and kinda slow
[shane = new Shane();] [3:49 PM] and I want to cut them off
[shane = new Shane();] [3:49 PM] but hola for Firefox like always let me watch netflix
[shane = new Shane();] [3:49 PM] and it's free
[shane = new Shane();] [3:50 PM] but then again people say they steal your browsing history and sell it
[shane = new Shane();] [4:03 PM] I just got to page four hundred of a fantasy novel
[shane = new Shane();] [4:04 PM] before all of the sudden the main character is interacting with an AI who is asking for a password to open a vault that's been sealed for a thousand years
[shane = new Shane();] [4:04 PM] like.. ok ok the distant future after apocalypse becoming like a primitive fantasy setting again is ok but
[shane = new Shane();] [4:04 PM] jesus this is played out
[shane = new Shane();] [4:05 PM] 'ah, this door must be locked by a spirit'
[shane = new Shane();] [4:05 PM] 'what do you want spirit'
[shane = new Shane();] [4:05 PM] please....
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] i know
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] i know this
[Victoria (Gelb)] [4:08 PM] you have to answer a riddle
[shane = new Shane();] [4:08 PM] ok so basically all of Europe is a bunch of tiny fighting kingdoms and everyone is back to swords and bows right
[shane = new Shane();] [4:09 PM] and the history tells of Plato and Jesus Christ and Rome and everything
[shane = new Shane();] [4:09 PM] and The Builders who built lots of ancient roads and huge buildings that they can't replicate anymore
[shane = new Shane();] [4:11 PM] this prince's father wants him to take down this kingdom and the people in the castle are all like red and sickly, and these deformed mutants all live beneath it
[shane = new Shane();] [4:11 PM] he finds out after reading ancient manuscripts that the deformities are likely caused by ancient poisons aka a vault full of chemical weapons
[shane = new Shane();] [4:12 PM] I cant decide if this is semi ok or utter garbage
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [4:57 PM] what is the book called
[shane = new Shane();] [4:59 PM] Prince of Thorns
[shane = new Shane();] [5:00 PM] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9579634-prince-of-thorns
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:10 PM] photo
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:10 PM] side not shane
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:12 PM] is prince of thorns like the thrive guild or brotherhood?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:12 PM] thieves
[100% not Corrie] [5:19 PM] hope that wasn't the twist shane, because now I'm gonna read it, sounds interesting
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] unsure if there are any twists
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] idk it's ok i just wanted to bitch somewhere about how
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] like
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] played out that is
[100% not Corrie] [5:21 PM] lol
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] and no not really jackie, the guy just walks around with his road crew of brothers
[shane = new Shane();] [5:21 PM] mostly just raping and burning
[100% not Corrie] [5:22 PM] alternate history kinda feels a little played out now when there's some WE DONE FUCKED UP OMG. There are some alternate histories that are played straight and more itneresting because of it
[100% not Corrie] [5:22 PM] ie. when the change is one that, you know, made sense
[100% not Corrie] [5:22 PM] not "WHAT IF HITLER HAD BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE US?!"
[shane = new Shane();] [5:25 PM] historical fiction can be cool
[shane = new Shane();] [5:25 PM] usually it's just like
[shane = new Shane();] [5:25 PM] WHAT IF DRACULA WAS THE REAL????
[shane = new Shane();] [5:25 PM] im referencing the Historian here which was like really well received
[100% not Corrie] [5:26 PM] I prefer the stuff that is like "WHAT IF FAERIES HAD BEEN ASLEEP AND NAZIS ACCIDENTALLY UNLEASHED THEM BACK ONTO THE WORLD DURING WWII AND HITLER MADE A PACT WITH THE LEADER AND THE ALLIES MADE PACTS WITH THE ENEMY PIXIES" etc etc
[100% not Corrie] [5:26 PM] like something completely off the wall
[100% not Corrie] [5:26 PM] or something completely plausible
[100% not Corrie] [5:26 PM] ie. what if Hitler had done x (that it's documented he almost did) instead of y?
[shane = new Shane();] [5:51 PM] wat if Hitler was actually space alien
[100% not Corrie] [5:51 PM] omg
[100% not Corrie] [5:51 PM] And first jew on earth was enemy space alien crashland on aerth
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:51 PM] I like historical fiction novels
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:52 PM] thats mostly what I read when I actually read,  other than ethnographic and politics
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:52 PM] ethnographies
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [5:52 PM] lame auto correct
[shane = new Shane();] [6:00 PM] can you tell me about
[shane = new Shane();] [6:00 PM] ethnographies
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:02 PM]  its all I read in college studying cultures.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:02 PM] its a scientific research of a culture
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:03 PM] ranging from tribes in the rainforest to cosplay and reenactors
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:03 PM] they are super interesting and I love them
[shane = new Shane();] [6:11 PM] ok gotcha
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [6:13 PM] so hows wednesday everyone
[100% not Corrie] [6:14 PM] I had to write an ethnography as a final project in my Human Geography class in undergrad. It was fun, but looking back on it, it was terribly written haha
[100% not Corrie] [6:14 PM] My wed is going well. Classes have progressed with no usual disturbances, got some reading done, one of my 1-on-1's cancelled, another was a no show
[100% not Corrie] [6:15 PM] https://mathisgasser.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/ted-chiang_story-of-your-life_2000.pdf

This is a ridiculously awesome short story if anyone wants to read it. If you like math or linguistics, it's def in your realm
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:23 PM] I will read that right now
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:23 PM] ooo corrie that's lots of free time
[100% not Corrie] [6:23 PM] It's fucking amazing
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:23 PM] whatever shall you do with it
[100% not Corrie] [6:23 PM] I read that. That's what I've done with it.
[100% not Corrie] [6:23 PM] I need to figure out my next programming project =/ coming up with shit from wholecloth is annoying
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:24 PM] that was the biggest problem with self-study. i feel like you learn programming the most when you have problems and you need to solve them
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:24 PM] and you check out the hook whilst the dj revolves them
[100% not Corrie] [6:24 PM] >__>
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:25 PM] i spent all day on regular expressions because my company is trying to make its own version of Latex fml
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:25 PM] #jargon
[100% not Corrie] [6:25 PM] #ihaveseenallofthosewords #idontknowwhatanyofthatreallymeans
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:26 PM] hahahahahah
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:26 PM] Regular Expressions are my favorite thing ever
[100% not Corrie] [6:26 PM] The problem with being someone with a shit ton of computer friends
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:26 PM] they are basically just patterns you learn to be able to take strings and find the exact information you are looking for
[100% not Corrie] [6:26 PM] I recognize like.... 95% of everything
[100% not Corrie] [6:26 PM] So people see the light of recognition in my eyes
[100% not Corrie] [6:26 PM] and think I understand them
[100% not Corrie] [6:26 PM] But it's like recognizing a work of van gogh as a painting
[100% not Corrie] [6:27 PM] and being able to DISCUSS van gogh
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:27 PM] also you're generally intelligent so people think you have the ability to understand as wel
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:27 PM] oh that's a great analogy
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:27 PM] "he painted shit."
"didn't he though"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:27 PM] "didn't he just"
[100% not Corrie] [6:27 PM] I understand life in metaphors. I speak mostly in metaphors. 
[100% not Corrie] [6:28 PM] It makes me sound faux intellectual when really I'm just struggling to digest concepts =/
[100% not Corrie] [6:29 PM] "Oh, this is a van gogh. I've seen it before." 

"AH! You know van gogh? How do you think his use of line in this work compares to his use of color in this other one?" 

"....Uh... He sure did."
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] hahahahhahahaha
[Victoria (Gelb)] [6:40 PM] jackie and i went to a vangogh exhibit in seoul a while ago, it was great funs

[100% not Corrie] [7:47 PM] .....Man, I could aprse that, but I'd need my dictionary constantly open :x
[shane = new Shane();] [7:47 PM] it takes me a long time so the object of studying is to be able to read and answer within the time limit
[shane = new Shane();] [7:48 PM] I think there's like an hour for reading and an hour for listening
[shane = new Shane();] [7:48 PM] we went back to the beginning of the section and now I can answer the easy ones within a minute
[shane = new Shane();] [7:48 PM] but these ones..
[100% not Corrie] [7:58 PM] Is this TOPIK material?
[shane = new Shane();] [8:10 PM] this is photo copied out of an old topik gest
[shane = new Shane();] [8:10 PM] you can take them online too, older ones in the same format covering the same stuff and testing you on the same ish range of verbs and sentence structure
[shane = new Shane();] [8:32 PM] Pierre just believed me when I pulled the IRL mmorpg joke
[shane = new Shane();] [8:32 PM] I feel bad because he isn't a native English speaker
[shane = new Shane();] [8:32 PM] but it's funny as heck

[shane = new Shane();] [8:34 PM] maybe
[shane = new Shane();] [8:35 PM] I got Pierre to play my favorite game
[shane = new Shane();] [8:35 PM] I feel bad because it's like really expensive and shitty

[shane = new Shane();] [10:04 AM] im about to finish this book and it's pretty good. there are more after it so despite my minor spoilers I do not think I took anytjing away from it
[shane = new Shane();] [10:04 AM] I feel compelled to note though as many reviewers said they simply could not read this book because of it.. the main character and his friends are rapists
[shane = new Shane();] [10:05 AM] it's not central to story, they just rape and kill because that's just part of life
[100% not Corrie] [10:08 AM] Ah, alright. I mean, if that's part of their characters... Not everyone is squeaky clean in real life.
[100% not Corrie] [11:51 AM] Sup fam
[shane = new Shane();] [11:54 AM] morning
[shane = new Shane();] [11:54 AM] afternoon, whatever
[shane = new Shane();] [11:54 AM] sup
[100% not Corrie] [11:55 AM] Morning grind. Coffee. Lesson plans. Regretting life.
[100% not Corrie] [11:56 AM] My cat hurt himself this morning so I woke up to having to calm down  a panicked cat and cleaning up drops of kitty blood =l
[100% not Corrie] [11:57 AM] Wouldnt leave his collar alone and got it stuck around his neck and in his mouth... Panicked and flipped out (until I woke up, no idea how long) and cut his gums on the fabric of the collar. He's okay. Mouth wounds are cake. Just freaked him, and me, the hell out
[100% not Corrie] [11:57 AM] On the other hand, when I woke up and approached him, he stood relatively still and just gave me a look like "Corrie. Help. Please."
[shane = new Shane();] [12:00 PM] Ah that's awful
[shane = new Shane();] [12:00 PM] At least he knew he needed help
[100% not Corrie] [12:01 PM] Yeah. Didn't like it when I took him to the faucet to the blood off his paws. "Actually, you know what? Corrie... No help. I don't need help. I'm fine. I'M FINE GOD DAMN IT."
[100% not Corrie] [12:01 PM] *clean the blood
[shane = new Shane();] [12:05 PM] Can't blame animals for not accepting that there are necessary discomforts
[shane = new Shane();] [12:05 PM] people don't even do it v well
[100% not Corrie] [12:05 PM] Yeah, I'm not mad at him, it was just annoying to have to deal with that first thing.
[shane = new Shane();] [12:06 PM] soz man
[100% not Corrie] [12:08 PM] Man, this feels so much better. I reinstalled SwiftKey because for some reason all my social media accounts "personalizing" my predictions had started really fucking up my typing speed
[100% not Corrie] [12:09 PM] And because I kept making similar mistakes over and over, it'd reinforce that in the prediction algorithms
[shane = new Shane();] [12:18 PM] my keyboard has not yet figured out that I mistakenly hit the space bar more than anything else
[100% not Corrie] [12:18 PM] For some reason when I first joined main, I assumed it was a teacher chat. These days I feel like it's IT/startup chat and I somehow snuck in the back to eat y'all's buffet haha
[shane = new Shane();] [12:18 PM] and the spacebar changes the current word to a prediction
[100% not Corrie] [12:19 PM] My problem was double terminal letters. I'd type "thank you" and end up with "thank k you"
[shane = new Shane();] [12:19 PM] hmm
[100% not Corrie] [12:20 PM] Actually, no, at first I thought it was lifting chat. Back when jk and a couple others were the main contributors
[100% not Corrie] [12:20 PM] Then it was teacher chat
[100% not Corrie] [12:20 PM] Now it's startup/IT chat
[shane = new Shane();] [12:21 PM] I think it's pretty varied
[100% not Corrie] [12:21 PM] Which is honestly interesting because it's a field I know next to nothing about and would love to be a part of eventually. But Jesus if it doesn't make me feel like a child to be so lost when y'all start taking the talk
[shane = new Shane();] [12:21 PM] I participate when I think it's interesting and then completely stop reading or interacting when stuff outside of my interest happens
[shane = new Shane();] [12:21 PM] And it's cool that there's a lot of different things that happen depending on who is active at the time
[100% not Corrie] [12:22 PM] My participation in main has dwindled so much these days. I got tired of being ignored, plus I have famchat, which is distilled main
[100% not Corrie] [12:22 PM] Just took two years, haha
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:23 PM] (emoticon)
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:23 PM] whats up guys
[shane = new Shane();] [12:23 PM] sitting in 36 degrees
[100% not Corrie] [12:24 PM] Sounds cold, Shane
[100% not Corrie] [12:24 PM] Turn on the heater
[shane = new Shane();] [12:24 PM] life is miserable
[100% not Corrie] [12:24 PM] Jackie ~
[100% not Corrie] [12:24 PM] (emoticon)
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:30 PM] im eating lunch.
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:30 PM] im happy
[100% not Corrie] [12:32 PM] What's for lunch?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:41 PM] food
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:42 PM] (emoticon)
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [12:42 PM] (emoticon)

[shane = new Shane();] [12:47 PM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [1:10 PM] Looks good!
[100% not Corrie] [2:21 PM] I'm modelling mainchat in python
[100% not Corrie] [2:21 PM] As an exercise in classes
[100% not Corrie] [2:21 PM] This is kinda fun
[shane = new Shane();] [2:22 PM] do you have me in there
[100% not Corrie] [2:22 PM] yup
[shane = new Shane();] [2:22 PM] what do I say
[100% not Corrie] [2:22 PM] "Shane here. Programmers rule."
[shane = new Shane();] [2:22 PM] "Programmers are so hot"
[shane = new Shane();] [2:22 PM] -shane 2016
[100% not Corrie] [2:22 PM] lol
[100% not Corrie] [2:23 PM] I've got two lists, fam and normies. Gonna divide normies in better groups based on their personalities... I think I'll add as many people in the chat as possible based on their activeness
[shane = new Shane();] [2:24 PM] based on their attractiveness*
[100% not Corrie] [2:24 PM] ^^^
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] problem is I'm just basically making a useless database type stucture using classes... don't know that I'll do anything with it... but it IS helping me keep class attributes straight in my head
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] and it's fun
[100% not Corrie] [2:25 PM] I can make PythonJackie say "Justin Bieber makes me wet." or PythonVictoria can extoll the virtures of nickelback
[shane = new Shane();] [2:26 PM] and eventually you'll have a database of vaguely victoria like sayings
[shane = new Shane();] [2:27 PM] and then you can script her to just go off
[100% not Corrie] [2:28 PM] oh shit, yeah, I can just compile a list of victoria-isms, give py.victoria a victoria.method() that just generates random victoria-isms everytime I call it
[100% not Corrie] [2:28 PM] For those random rainy days when I don't have enough victoria in my life
[100% not Corrie] [2:29 PM] pythotoria will soon replace the real victoria in efficiency
[100% not Corrie] [2:29 PM] meanwhile pythane is in an infinite loop of describing himself in various formulations using the word "sexy"
[100% not Corrie] [2:29 PM] This is gonna be great
[shane = new Shane();] [2:38 PM] sounds sexy
[shane = new Shane();] [2:38 PM] like me
[shane = new Shane();] [2:49 PM] I took a MySpace angle photo last night
[shane = new Shane();] [2:49 PM] but unfortunately in my middle age it just made me look fat
[100% not Corrie] [2:51 PM] I've made a python shane that spits out random things involving the word shane
[100% not Corrie] [2:52 PM] I need to expand his sentence pool
[100% not Corrie] [2:52 PM] and increase functionality
[100% not Corrie] [2:52 PM] But soon you will be replaced, Shane
[100% not Corrie] [2:55 PM] I feel like I've made more progress dicking around in the last week than I have doing nothing in the past year =/
[shane = new Shane();] [2:56 PM] me too thanks
[100% not Corrie] [2:57 PM] What's everyone doing?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:57 PM] work
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:58 PM] being vaguely sad
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:58 PM] take your pic
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:58 PM] *pick
[Victoria (Gelb)] [2:58 PM] also take your selfie
[100% not Corrie] [2:58 PM] Why are you sad?
[100% not Corrie] [2:58 PM] photo
[100% not Corrie] [2:58 PM] (emoticon)
[shane = new Shane();] [3:00 PM] don't be sad
[shane = new Shane();] [3:00 PM] photo

[100% not Corrie] [3:02 PM] Selca Thursday
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:02 PM] aw you guys look nice
[100% not Corrie] [3:02 PM] AND YOUR SELFIE, VIC?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:03 PM] i'm okay
[100% not Corrie] [3:05 PM] SEND SELFIE
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:06 PM] you know the episode of buffy
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:06 PM] when buffy slept with that dude...Parker?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:06 PM] shane i know you nkow
[100% not Corrie] [3:08 PM] You slept with someone you shouldn't have? >__>
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:11 PM] corrie, did you watch buffy?
[shane = new Shane();] [3:11 PM] Buffy wakes up in Parker's dorm room and he says he'll call her later, so she leaves happy
[shane = new Shane();] [3:11 PM] Then later when he doesn't call she looks around and finds him chatting someone else up that evening.
[100% not Corrie] [3:12 PM] I watched a few episodes, and a few of angel
[100% not Corrie] [3:12 PM] I should go back through and watch them all
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] I've seen every episode multiple times
[100% not Corrie] [3:12 PM] oh.... is that what happened, victoria? =/
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] no
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] it's more like
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] she can't get over it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] she's all like "no i meant something"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:12 PM] when it's like "bitch plz, he was just trying to get it in and you can't get over it"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:13 PM] *it meant something
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:13 PM] I feel like I'm her because it didn't and I can't just drop it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:13 PM] THE END
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:13 PM] (emoticon)
[100% not Corrie] [3:13 PM] ....is this about Jed?
[shane = new Shane();] [3:13 PM] I'm sorry Victoria.
[100% not Corrie] [3:13 PM] =/
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:14 PM] I'll get over it
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:14 PM] it's just I didn't even like him that much! he semed like he was way more into me!
[shane = new Shane();] [3:15 PM] that's so fucking weird
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 PM] and now i don't even get the opportunity to start an unfufilling relationship with him and slowly start to resent him
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:15 PM] he could've at least given me that
[100% not Corrie] [3:20 PM] Maaaan, that sucks =/ 
[100% not Corrie] [3:20 PM] Well you know what you have to do now, right?
[100% not Corrie] [3:21 PM] Create an elaborate straw man of him in your head that repeatedly fails in hypotethical situations whom you can resent freely so that next time you run into him you can berate him for his theoretical failures!
[shane = new Shane();] [3:21 PM] kill his family
[shane = new Shane();] [3:21 PM] oh
[100% not Corrie] [3:21 PM] I'm sure that's healthy
[shane = new Shane();] [3:21 PM] no we could just drink
[100% not Corrie] [3:21 PM] Isn't that what I just fucking said
[100% not Corrie] [3:21 PM] Shane
[100% not Corrie] [3:21 PM] Damn
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:21 PM] photo
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:21 PM] im late
[100% not Corrie] [3:22 PM] That's why you shoudl alwyas wrap it
[100% not Corrie] [3:22 PM] before you tap it
[100% not Corrie] [3:22 PM] jackie
[shane = new Shane();] [3:22 PM] hi jackie
[100% not Corrie] [3:22 PM] Jackie, what do you want jackiebot to say?
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:22 PM] awesome
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:23 PM] (emoticon)emoticon
[100% not Corrie] [3:23 PM] Alright. Jackie bot will say awesome in multiple languages
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:23 PM] i want bants
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:23 PM] make pythonme have the bants
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:23 PM] jackie i like your shirt dress thing
[100% not Corrie] [3:23 PM] ...bants?
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] like pants?
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] but on the butt?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] when have you ever seen me with pants
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] bants
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] banter
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] riffin
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] ah
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] okay
[100% not Corrie] [3:24 PM] gotcha
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] i know realize maybe only shane and me call them "bants"
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:24 PM] *now realize
[shane = new Shane();] [3:25 PM] and only jackie says awesome
[Jack Jack Jackin' It] [3:25 PM] awesome
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 PM] I've realized I've cloven to 100% =/
[shane = new Shane();] [3:25 PM] cloven?
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 PM] In the last two weeks I've started saying it SO FUCKING MUCH
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 PM] Don't know why
[100% not Corrie] [3:25 PM] Cleave means to cling to something in a strong manner
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:25 PM] he's 100 cloven
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 PM] he's a centaur
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:26 PM] RUN
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 PM] YOU CAN'T MILK ME
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 PM] I MEAN OUTRUN ME
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 PM] DUDE
[100% not Corrie] [3:26 PM] I know what python me will do
[100% not Corrie] [3:27 PM] and it'll take a bunch of practice to get it right
[100% not Corrie] [3:27 PM] It'll parse whatever any of the other bots say through a thesaurus
[100% not Corrie] [3:27 PM] and say the exact same thing, just with everything possible thesaurized
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:30 PM] natural language parsing is actually a real big area in cs
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:31 PM] i was kind of into it for a while when i was trying to make a script to auto-name our functions based on certain descriptions
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:31 PM] it's really cool and i can't wait to see what...I...say
[shane = new Shane();] [3:32 PM] victoria
[shane = new Shane();] [3:32 PM] so predictable
[shane = new Shane();] [3:33 PM] literally only participates in discussions to see how well she does
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 PM] How am I doing guys?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 PM] How was that sentence?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 PM] Or that one?
[Victoria (Gelb)] [3:34 PM] Let me know!
